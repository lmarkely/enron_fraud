### Task 1: Select what features you'll use.
### features_list is a list of strings, each of which is a feature name.
### The first feature must be "poi".
features_list = ['poi','salary'] # You will need to use more features

### Load the dictionary containing the dataset
with open("final_project_dataset.pkl", "r") as data_file:
    data_dict = pickle.load(data_file)

### Task 2: Remove outliers
### First, explore the dataset.
### Identify the total number of data points.
print 'Total number of data points:',len(data_dict)


### Task 3: Create new feature(s)
### Store to my_dataset for easy export below.
my_dataset = data_dict

### Extract features and labels from dataset for local testing
data = featureFormat(my_dataset, features_list, sort_keys = True)
labels, features = targetFeatureSplit(data)

### Task 4: Try a varity of classifiers
### Please name your classifier clf for easy export below.
### Note that if you want to do PCA or other multi-stage operations,
### you'll need to use Pipelines. For more info:
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/pipeline.html

# Provided to give you a starting point. Try a variety of classifiers.
# The followings are the major steps in the analysis:
# A. Visualize the data using dimensionality reduction PCA and LDA to gain
#    further insight into the data
# B. Algorithm selection using repeated nested cross validation to choose
#    the algorithm that has highest accuracy
# C. Model selection using repeated cross validation to identify the best
#    hyperparameter values

# The following classification algorithms are used:
# 1. Logistic Regression
# 2. Random Forest Classifier
# 3. KNN Classifier
# 4. Support Vector Classifier
# 5. Neural Network: Multi-layer Perceptron Classifier

### Task 5: Tune your classifier to achieve better than .3 precision and recall
### using our testing script. Check the tester.py script in the final project
### folder for details on the evaluation method, especially the test_classifier
### function. Because of the small size of the dataset, the script uses
### stratified shuffle split cross validation. For more info:
### http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit.html

# Example starting point. Try investigating other evaluation techniques!

    train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

### Task 6: Dump your classifier, dataset, and features_list so anyone can
### check your results. You do not need to change anything below, but make sure
### that the version of poi_id.py that you submit can be run on its own and
### generates the necessary .pkl files for validating your results.
